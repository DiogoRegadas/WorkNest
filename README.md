WorkNest is an **academic full-stack project** developed as the final assignment of my **BSc in Computer Science and Engineering**.  
It is a **collaboration and project management platform** designed to centralize multiple productivity functionalities into a single space — helping reduce **digital fatigue** caused by constant switching between scattered tools (ex.: Trello, Slack, Google Docs, Notion, etc.)

Designed with a strong focus on **functional centralization**, usability, and modern development practices.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

- Develop a unified platform combining project management + communication tools  
- Reduce "digital fatigue" caused by fragmented platforms  
- Explore real-time collaboration features  
- Apply clean software engineering practices learned across the degree  
- Demonstrate full-stack development and architectural design  

This was built as an **individual academic project**, with full responsibility for design, architecture, development, testing, and documentation.
